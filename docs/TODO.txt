IN PROGRESS

GROOMED
* Copy a 'lib' or 'bin' from one SHCF_APP to another 
* Copy an ShSDK lib or bin to SHCF_APP

NICE TO HAVE
* Create a 'standalone' option to shcf_cli 

DONE
* Change structure so that 'core ShSDK' and project is clearly demarcated, ie:
    > core     - core ShSDK scripts (intended NOT to be touched) 
    > projects - individual group of scripts
* Ability to create a 'lib' or 'bin' within the ShSDK environment
