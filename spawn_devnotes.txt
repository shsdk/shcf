"spawn" was conceptualized way before shcf was fully turned into an ShSDK. Therefore,
   - clean-up all reference to framework directories. MUST BE referencing 'project/projectname' directories
   - ensure use of temp directory within 'project/projectname'
   - Add the 'project/projectname/opt/spawned' reference in config file
   - test on linux (specially syntax for usage of 'mktemp')
   - any other optimizations
   - test on 'spawning' shsdk itself
   - simplify usage so that 2nd parameter to spawn is automatically the same as project name.
	e.g. 'spawn hello hello' becomes just 'spawn hello' unless a new bin is used
   - recreated needed config / directories input/output. Call it 'pre-spawn'
   - check if last lib to concat has 1 space at end of file. Add if missing. (for cleaner output)

NOTE: Delete this notes once ready to merge to master.
